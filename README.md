# Pygame Furmark Clone
Clone of the benchmarking tool Furmark made with Pygame and ModernGL.

## Install 

```
pip install moderngl-window
```

## Usage

To start the benchmark just start `main.py`, benchmark result will appear in the terminal once the program is closed.  
You can replace the tunnel and taurus texture by modifying line 15 in `main.py` to replace the taurus texture and line 23 to replace the tunnel texture.
NOTE: This benchmark features 4x MSAA (Multi sampling anti aliasing meaning that everything will be rendered 4 times to improve edge clarity).
