# Pygame Furmark Clone
Clone of the benchmarking tool Furmark made with Pygame and ModernGL.

## Installation

Run this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
while in the directory folder.

NOTE: Python 3+ required.

## Usage

To start the benchmark just start `main.py`, benchmark result will appear in the terminal once the program is closed.  
You can replace the tunnel and taurus texture by modifying line 15 in `main.py` to replace the taurus texture and line 23 to replace the tunnel texture.
NOTE: This benchmark features 4x MSAA (Multi sampling anti aliasing meaning that everything will be rendered 4 times to improve edge clarity).
